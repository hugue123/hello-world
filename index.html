  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
  <p> My name is Michael Xavier Hugue. I have been creating artwork and using my talent since the third grade. <br />
   As an Artist, I love to display those life messages and lessons through my artwork. <br /> 
My entire collection I gave the name “My Story” because it was life changing experiences that influenced me to create my artwork.<br />
I’ve enrolled at Miami International University of Art & Design, to pursue a Bachelor Degree in Graphic Design. <br /> 
I enjoy riding my bike and traveling, networking doing artshows painting and helping others. <br />
